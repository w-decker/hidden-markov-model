    "As seen in the weather example found within the [Introduction](Introduction.ipynb), the visual used to present the weather example is called a _transition diagram_. However this is inefficent to read when working with more states and more transitions. To do this, we can use a _transition matrix_ which I will explain further below.\n",

    "This is what a transition matrix may look like. What is the probability of transitioning to $B$ if the current state is $A$? Well, we first look at the left-most column, which represents all the current states. Stop at $A$. Then we continue into $A$'s row until we hit $B$. The probability in that cell is 0.25. So there is a 0.25 probability that we will transition to state $B$ if we are currently on state $A$.\n",
