# Welcome to your Jupyter Book

What is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in cognitive neuroscience? Here, I have gathered and vetted resources to 1) clearly explain the mathematical foundations of HMMs and 2) proivde real world examples in the literature which make use of HMMs.

Note: I have created this repository purely as a learning resource for myself. I am no expert and, thus, creating this repo gives me a space to document and demonstrate these Markovian concepts so that I may better understand them. If you would like to contribute, just submit a pull request or send me resources that you believe would be helpful in better understanding HMMs.
