# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! You can contribute in the ways listed below.

## Providing examples

Given my current status, this side project can only be tended to in limited amounts. If you are aware of any literature that makes use of HMMs or any other Markovian processes, please email me.

## Write Documentation

This repository could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official Hidden Markov Model docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

## Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue on GitHub.

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)
